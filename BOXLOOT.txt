>>PLAYER DROPS:
>>This is used for the character-specific health pickups that enemies can drop.
>>First parameter should be the name of the player class.
>>Second parameter should be the "Suffix" of your Loot item. Example: "MelonHealth", "MelonArmor", "MelonEnergy"
>>If a player is not listed here, that player will not have any drops.
>>If the drop does not exist, the player will not have any drops. This is used to prevent Glass from having any drops.

>>AMMO DROPS:
>>This is used for the ammo pickups that enemies can drop.
>>Set the first parameter to "false" if you do not want this weapon to drop ammo.
>>The second parameter should be the name of the weapon class.
>>The third parameter is the ammo type that is checked, and is also used for loot drops.
>>Ammo drops for weapons use the same name as the main ammo class, but with "Drop" added as a suffix. Example: "PartyShottyAmmo" = "PartyShottyAmmoDrop"
>>By default, if the ammo is at 0, the weapon is marked as able to drop ammo. However, you can change this by making the fourth parameter higher than 0.
>>If a weapon is not listed here, that weapon will not have any drops.
