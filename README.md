## Requirements:
  -GZDOOM 4.7.1
  
  -That's it

## Installing Box Party (from Github):
  1. [Download a fresh copy of GZDOOM, and extract the folder somewhere.](https://zdoom.org/downloads)

  2. Either download the latest release on the "Releases" page or download the latest commit and name the zip file `boxparty.ipk3`.
  
  3. Place your `boxparty.ipk3` file inside the GZDOOM folder. (The file extension should be `.ipk3`, not `.zip`.)
  
  4. Run `gzdoom.exe`, and you're good to go! :)
  
  5. To update, simply start at step 2 and replace the old `boxparty.ipk3` with the new one.
  
## Disclaimers + Making Mods:
  -This is the first ever video game I've actually made. If you're going to look through Box Party's code, expect it to be ***very*** messy. :)
I've tried my best to make Box Party modding friendly, however it is far from perfect.

  -A lot of the behind-the-scenes code for Box Party is subject to change, so be aware that any potential mods you create that are more in depth than just like a level or a hat or a character may end up breaking when Box Party receives an update.

  -Multiplayer is not functional as of this moment. Desyncs are rampant. I'm hoping to fix this at some point soon.

Box Party has a few unique mechanics that should (hopefully) take minimal effort to add new content for, like the loot and hat systems.

I will be working on a Github Wiki to try to document these mechanics to the best of my ability.
